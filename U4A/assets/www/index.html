				<h1>The full PC desktop for <wbr>multi&#8209;core&nbsp;Android&nbsp;phones</h1>
				<p>Now multi-core Android phones can be PCs too. Ubuntu for
					Android enables high-end Android handsets to run Ubuntu, the
					world’s favourite free PC desktop operating system. So users get
					the Android they know on the move, but when they connect their
					phone to a monitor, mouse and keyboard, it becomes a PC.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="page">
				<h1>The number one free desktop on <wbr>the&nbsp;number&nbsp;one&nbsp;open&nbsp;phone</h1>
				<p>With over 20 million users, Ubuntu is the world’s favourite
					free operating system – and Ubuntu for Android is the first
					complete solution for office productivity on a phone. <br><br>It lets
					Android and Ubuntu share the same Linux kernel, so they can run at
					the same time – Android for the phone experience and Ubuntu when
					docked. Which means one address book, one set of bookmarks, one
					place for text messages and one inbox for mail. And thanks to
					careful integration between the Ubuntu desktop and Android, user’s
					have access to the phone’s functions when it’s docked – including
					making and receiving calls.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="page">
				<h1>Just cause for more cores</h1>
				<p>
					Ubuntu for Android gives mobile workers a compelling reason to
					upgrade to multi-core handsets with more RAM, more storage, faster
					GPUs and CPUs. It’s not just a phone they are buying, it’s a
					desktop too. <br><br>While mid-range phones can deliver a perfect Android
					experience, it takes high-end horsepower to drive a phone and a
					desktop at the same time. Newer multi-core processors are up to the
					job, and Ubuntu is the killer app for that hot hardware. It’s the
					must-have feature for late-2012 high-end Android phones. </br> </p>
					
					
					
					<p class="citat">
					&#8220;Ubuntu is the </br> <strong>killer app</strong> for </br>multi-core
					phones <br />in 2012&#8221;
					</p>
					
					<p>
					</br> A
					built-in desktop is also a driver of LTE, which offers higher
					bandwidth for productivity apps and lower latency for business
					users. Cloud apps like Google Docs are best used with a full
					desktop, and shine with LTE. <br><br>The phone has traditionally been a
					slower, less productive tool. When you’re at a desktop, you want to
					get things done, quickly. So you appreciate the difference between
					3G and 4G. Adding a desktop to the phone justifies the extra cost
					of newer network technologies for business customers.
				</p>

				<h1>New markets, <wbr>new&nbsp;opportunities</h1>
				<p>
					For phone manufacturers eager to expand their audience, Ubuntu for
					Android gives access to entirely new markets. </br> </br> Enterprise IT
					departments currently support a PC and at least one phone for every
					desk-based worker. Our solution reduces their burden to a single
					device for every user. So Ubuntu for Android helps you tap into the
					lucrative corporate PC replacement and thin client markets. Ubuntu
					is already the most popular replacement for Windows on the
					corporate desktop, with deployments of tens of thousands of
					desktops in multiple institutions. </br> </br> In developing economies, where
					there is little historical PC penetration, the phone can define
					personal computing for an audience that has no legacy attachment to
					the desktop. For the next billion knowledge workers, their first PC
					could be their first smartphone, but they’ll need a device that can
					do more than just be a handset, if they really want to shine. </br> </br>
					Ubuntu ships pre-installed on millions of PC’s from major
					manufacturers in China, India and Brazil today. It’s easy, it has
					an amazing range of software on tap, and it’s totally integrated
					with our personal cloud service, Ubuntu One. Pure 21st century
					goodness.
				</p>

				<h1>Easy to integrate to your <wbr>Android&nbsp;phone</h1>
				<p>
					Ubuntu for Android drops in cleanly alongside the rest of Android,
					so it is easy to integrate into current production roadmaps. The
					hardware requirements are straightforward and, with a broad range
					of ARM and x86 hardware supported, it can realistically be added to
					phones already in development. </br> </br> Of course, your phone needs the
					docking capability and hardware support for HDMI and USB. But
					that’s standard for high-end models in the current generation of
					devices in development.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="page">
				<h1>The world’s favourite free desktop <wbr>-&nbsp;for&nbsp;business&nbsp;and&nbsp;home</h1>
				<p>
					The Ubuntu desktop sets the standard for ease of use. That’s one
					reason why Ubuntu is now the world’s favourite free operating
					system - on the desktop as well as the server. It’s shipped by more
					PC brands, used by more people, targeted by more developers and
					covered by more journalists than any other Linux desktop. </br>
					</p>
					
					<img class = 'bilder' src="./diagram.png" alt="some_text">
					<p>
					</br> </br> Ubuntu for Android is a complete desktop with a full range of
					desktop applications including office, web browsing, email, media
					and messaging. Personal information like contacts, calendars, photo
					galleries and music can be accessed from both the phone and the
					desktop interface. SMS texts arrive on your desktop if you are
					docked when they show up, and calls are handled like VoIP if you
					want to stay working while you chat. Ubuntu for Android brings the
					desktop world together with the phone world, seamlessly. </br> </br> Our
					reputation and brand have taken seven years to create. Because we
					care about quality, Ubuntu selects only the very best applications
					for install by default. And because we care about security, Ubuntu
					includes free security updates across more applications than any
					competitor. During the netbook era, every manufacturer created
					their own Linux, but customers rebelled. Today, they ship Ubuntu.

				<h1>A whole new peripheral ecosystem</h1>
				<p>
					Users will want at least one dock, complete with monitor, keyboard
					and mouse. Many will want two of each - one for the office and one
					for the home. And mobile users will opt for clamshell devices that
					give them a laptop experience whenever they need it - on the train,
					on the plane or in meetings. </br> </br> [bild] </br> </br> Desktop productivity goes
					well beyond the keyboard, monitor and mouse. Imagine projectors
					with a phone dock built in, so you can carry less to your
					presentations. And imagine TVs that become home PCs when you dock
					your phone: perfect for the emerging market where LTE will be the
					normal way for new users to connect to the Internet.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="page">
				<h1>Why add anything to Android?</h1>
				<p>
					Android is a mobile solution, designed for a touch interface on a
					handheld device. On the desktop, where users expect a
					pointer-driven experience, a PC operating system is essential.
					Several vendors have tried to bring Android-based desktops or
					laptops to market, with no success; Android was designed for touch
					only, and has its hands full winning the tablet wars. </br> </br> A complete
					desktop solution needs a full range of desktop applications. While
					a mobile OS carries no deep desktop software catalogue, Ubuntu
					offers thousands of applications, all designed for the desktop and
					most, like Ubuntu, free. And Ubuntu is certified by governments,
					industry and enterprises, widely deployed on the desktop, and
					supported by leading management solutions. </br> </br> Another alternative
					would be a web-top, or web only desktop. But markets have not
					responded to web-only environments. The desktop is a
					high-productivity mode, not a media consumption mode or a browsing
					mode. That’s why we’ve brought the full power of a native desktop
					to this solution.

				<h1>Backed by Canonical</h1>
				<p>
					Canonical is the commercial entity behind Ubuntu. We have staff in
					more than 30 countries, with offices in London, Boston, Taipei,
					Montreal, Shanghai, and São Paulo. </br> </br> We have been working with the
					ARM architecture for years, having co-founded Linaro, the
					consortium dedicated to the unification of Linux on ARM and the
					locus of development for ARM on servers and laptops. Canonical and
					Vodafone shipped the world’s first ARM smartbook. Our OEM team has
					years of experience in bringing new products to market, providing
					complete, end-to-end solutions - identifying opportunities,
					developing strategies and ensuring a stunning experience on every
					Ubuntu device.
