					<div class="scrollable">
						<p class='text'>With over 20 million users, Ubuntu is the
							world’s favourite free operating system – and Ubuntu for Android
							is the first complete solution for office productivity on a
							phone. It lets Android and Ubuntu share the same Linux kernel, so
							they can run at the same time – Android for the phone experience
							and Ubuntu when docked. Which means one address book, one set of
							bookmarks, one place for text messages and one inbox for mail.
							And thanks to careful integration between the Ubuntu desktop and
							Android, user’s have access to the phone’s functions when it’s
							docked – including making and receiving calls.</p>

						<p class='text'>

							Ubuntu for Android gives mobile workers a compelling reason to
							upgrade to multi-core handsets with more RAM, more storage,
							faster GPUs and CPUs. It’s not just a phone they are buying, it’s
							a desktop too. While mid-range phones can deliver a perfect
							Android experience, it takes high-end horsepower to drive a phone
							and a desktop at the same time. Newer multi-core processors are
							up to the job, and Ubuntu is the killer app for that hot
							hardware. It’s the must-have feature for late-2012 high-end
							Android phones. </br> </br> A built-in desktop is also a driver of LTE,
							which offers higher bandwidth for productivity apps and lower
							latency for business users. Cloud apps like Google Docs are best
							used with a full desktop, and shine with LTE. The phone has
							traditionally been a slower, less productive tool. When you’re at
							a desktop, you want to get things done, quickly. So you
							appreciate the difference between 3G and 4G. Adding a desktop to
							the phone justifies the extra cost of newer network technologies
							for business customers.

					<h1>New markets, new opportunities</h1>
					<div class="scrollable">
						<p class='text'>

							For phone manufacturers eager to expand their audience, Ubuntu
							for Android gives access to entirely new markets. </br> </br> Enterprise IT
							departments currently support a PC and at least one phone for
							every desk-based worker. Our solution reduces their burden to a
							single device for every user. So Ubuntu for Android helps you tap
							into the lucrative corporate PC replacement and thin client
							markets. Ubuntu is already the most popular replacement for
							Windows on the corporate desktop, with deployments of tens of
							thousands of desktops in multiple institutions. </br> </br> In developing
							economies, where there is little historical PC penetration, the
							phone can define personal computing for an audience that has no
							legacy attachment to the desktop. For the next billion knowledge
							workers, their first PC could be their first smartphone, but
							they’ll need a device that can do more than just be a handset, if
							they really want to shine. </br> </br> Ubuntu ships pre-installed on
							millions of PC’s from major manufacturers in China, India and
							Brazil today. It’s easy, it has an amazing range of software on
							tap, and it’s totally integrated with our personal cloud service,
							Ubuntu One. Pure 21st century goodness.

					<h1>Easy to integrate to your Android phone</h1>
					<div class="scrollable">
						<p class='text'>

							Ubuntu for Android drops in cleanly alongside the rest of
							Android, so it is easy to integrate into current production
							roadmaps. The hardware requirements are straightforward and, with
							a broad range of ARM and x86 hardware supported, it can
							realistically be added to phones already in development. </br> </br> Of
							course, your phone needs the docking capability and hardware
							support for HDMI and USB. But that’s standard for high-end models
							in the current generation of devices in development.

					<h1>The world’s favourite free desktop - for business and home</h1>
					<div class="scrollable">
						<p class='text'>

							The Ubuntu desktop sets the standard for ease of use. That’s one
							reason why Ubuntu is now the world’s favourite free operating
							system - on the desktop as well as the server. It’s shipped by
							more PC brands, used by more people, targeted by more developers
							and covered by more journalists than any other Linux desktop. </br> </br>

							[bild] </br> </br> Ubuntu for Android is a complete desktop with a full
							range of desktop applications including office, web browsing,
							email, media and messaging. Personal information like contacts,
							calendars, photo galleries and music can be accessed from both
							the phone and the desktop interface. SMS texts arrive on your
							desktop if you are docked when they show up, and calls are
							handled like VoIP if you want to stay working while you chat.
							Ubuntu for Android brings the desktop world together with the
							phone world, seamlessly. </br> </br> Our reputation and brand have taken
							seven years to create. Because we care about quality, Ubuntu
							selects only the very best applications for install by default.
							And because we care about security, Ubuntu includes free security
							updates across more applications than any competitor. During the
							netbook era, every manufacturer created their own Linux, but
							customers rebelled. Today, they ship Ubuntu.

					<h1>A whole new peripheral ecosystem</h1>

						<p class='text'>

							Users will want at least one dock, complete with monitor,
							keyboard and mouse. Many will want two of each - one for the
							office and one for the home. And mobile users will opt for
							clamshell devices that give them a laptop experience whenever
							they need it - on the train, on the plane or in meetings. </br> </br>
							[bild] </br> </br> Desktop productivity goes well beyond the keyboard,
							monitor and mouse. Imagine projectors with a phone dock built in,
							so you can carry less to your presentations. And imagine TVs that
							become home PCs when you dock your phone: perfect for the
							emerging market where LTE will be the normal way for new users to
							connect to the Internet.

					<h1>Why add anything to Android?</h1>
					<div class="scrollable">
						<p class='text'>

							Android is a mobile solution, designed for a touch interface on a
							handheld device. On the desktop, where users expect a
							pointer-driven experience, a PC operating system is essential.
							Several vendors have tried to bring Android-based desktops or
							laptops to market, with no success; Android was designed for
							touch only, and has its hands full winning the tablet wars. </br> </br> A
							complete desktop solution needs a full range of desktop
							applications. While a mobile OS carries no deep desktop software
							catalogue, Ubuntu offers thousands of applications, all designed
							for the desktop and most, like Ubuntu, free. And Ubuntu is
							certified by governments, industry and enterprises, widely
							deployed on the desktop, and supported by leading management
							solutions. </br> </br> Another alternative would be a web-top, or web only
							desktop. But markets have not responded to web-only environments.
							The desktop is a high-productivity mode, not a media consumption
							mode or a browsing mode. That’s why we’ve brought the full power
							of a native desktop to this solution.
